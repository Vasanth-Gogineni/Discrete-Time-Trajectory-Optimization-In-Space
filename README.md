This research project uses the GEKKO Python package to extend the APMonitor Modeling Language. View the YouTube video below(in README.md) for an explanation of the code and an example of a test run. This video is uploaded on the APMonitor YouTube channel.

There are also 2 symposium presentations of the same project. For a more general view of the applications and the physics behind this algorithm, please visit the symposium video. To view a description of the code and samples of live testing, please watch the APMonitor YouTube video.
